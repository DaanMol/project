# The Presidential Cheatsheet
An overview of the people's opinion on the highest seat in the USA

## The Grand Timeline
The purpose of this data visualisation is to present the user with an overview of the 
approval rating of the President of the United States of America from 1940 until present.

## The Individual
Upon intercation with the linegraph, the user is shown a graph representing the approval
rating of an individual president for a more detailed view on the people's opinion regarding
the POTUS. Behind the line is a representation of the division of seats in the house of Congress.
It's a stacked bar chart making it easy for the user to see which party had the majority
of seats at a given time period. On the line itself are dots that link to a historical event
that might have influenced the approval rating of the president.

## The History
These dots are clickable, and when interacted with, a relevant image pops up, and a button 
linking to a corresponding online article regarding the event.

## The Division
Additionally, when a president is selected in the overall timeline, or when another president
is selected using the navigation buttons in the individual graph, a map is drawn showing the
division of electoral votes during the elections. The state's color represents the party that
received the most votes. When a state is clicked, it's statistics during the selected 
elections are shown in a table. If the selected president was elected more than once, a 
drop down menu is shown, letting the user choose which election they want to see.
