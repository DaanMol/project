# day 3

Created the overall timeline of the president's approval rating. User can
hover over a president's time period and see the average score. The area lights
up and a red borders lights up.
Added an individual line chart for the president's approval rating. Currently
hardcoded for Roosevelt. Dots in the chart represent the data points.

# day 4

The individual chart now updates properly and the points move as well.
Scales update accordingly, title shows selected president.
Created a map of the USA, without a tooltip.

# day 5
Friday
Matched the state id's to their name and vice versa.
Tooltip works.
The data in votes.json now properly formatted for democrates and republicans.

# day 6
Monday
Added a table to the map of the States, showing the votes, % and EV for each
party. It updates as another state is selected, another election is selected or
when another president is selected.
Added a dropdown menu for multiple elections per president. For president Ford,
a message is shown that no elections were held, as he was the vice president of
Nixon, whom was impeached after the Watergate scandal.

# day 7
Tuesday
Added a style guide.
Added nav buttons to the individual graph for easier navigation through
presidents.
Fixing error message when a state has no data, added error message when
a state without data is clicked on the map.

# day 8
Wednesday
Fixed Image at the top right.

# day 9
Thursday
Created initial static stacked  bar chart of the congress seats for
Roosevelt.
Made the bar chart dynamic, though there still are some overlaps.
The bar chart is in front of the line and the buttons, making it impossible
to navigate using the buttons.
It works now. I had to format the dates before creating a scale.
Fixed a bunch of error messages in the console.
